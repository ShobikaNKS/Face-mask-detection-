*Problem Statement*:
The project aimed to develop a system capable of detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks in images or video streams, primarily for enforcing safety measures in public spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic.

*Methodology and Techniques Used*:
One of the key techniques used in this project was Haar cascades for face detection, implemented through OpenCV's cv2.CascadeClassifier. This allowed me to identify faces within images or video frames efficiently. Additionally, I utilized a pre-trained deep learning model for mask detection, such as MobileNet or YOLO, which I integrated with OpenCV for inference.

*Dataset*:
The project utilized a dataset containing images of individuals with and without face masks, with annotations indicating the presence or absence of masks. OpenCV was instrumental in preprocessing the dataset, including tasks such as resizing images, extracting regions of interest (faces), and augmenting the data to improve model generalization.

*Model Training*:
While OpenCV was primarily used for tasks such as data preprocessing and inference, the machine learning model itself was trained separately using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. OpenCV facilitated the integration of the trained model into the face detection pipeline, allowing for real-time inference on video streams or batches of images.

*Evaluation Metrics*:
The performance of the system was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which were calculated based on the model's predictions on a test dataset. OpenCV's visualization capabilities were also utilized to generate visualizations of the model's outputs, including bounding boxes around detected faces and masks.

*Results and Performance*:
The integrated system achieved promising results, with high accuracy in detecting both faces and face masks in real-world scenarios. OpenCV's robustness and efficiency were crucial in ensuring that the system could perform inference in real-time, making it suitable for deployment in various environments.

*Future Improvements*:
Moving forward, there are several avenues for improvement, including fine-tuning the deep learning model for better performance on specific datasets, optimizing the face detection pipeline for speed and accuracy, and exploring additional features such as facial landmark detection for more precise mask localization.
